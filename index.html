        <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
        <p>Cryptocurrency can get quite a bit complicated, but this video below explains it really well. NOTE: This video has some profanity</p>

        <p>Basically cryptocurrency exists virtually and has no physical form and it is decentralized. Decentralized simply means it is not owned by any central bank or group. It uses the blockchain technology to track and update transactions and it is also part of the reason why cryptocurrency is considered more secure, because the information cannot be easily altered and your identity is based on a public key and private key, therefore you can remain anonymous. It has a self regulating inflation rate based on supply and demand like the cryptocurrency Bitcoin for example, it halves the amount that can be rewarded or generated every 4 years. This means the amount is finite and since there will never be an excess amount of cryptocurrency the value of the currency would not drop as long as the demand is more than the supply of the currency. Maintaining a scarce supply of cryptocurrency protects its value. On a global scale it is a stable currency that countries with unstable currency value can benefit from, because it is decentralized it would not collapse if that countries government or bank collapse.

        <h2>Regulating Cryptocurrency</h2>
        <p>With the advantages of cryptocurrency it threatens the existence of all banks. Users of cryptocurrency can avoid bank transaction fees and have a much more secure and private transaction.Besides being a threat to banks it is also used for illicit transactions. There have also been many <a href="https://blocktelegraph.io/cryptocurrency-fraud-cases/" title="crypto-fraud">crypto currency fraud cases, the most famous one was a ponzi scheme called BitConnect which yielded $733 million. </a> 
        From this we can see there are some issues regarding cryptocurrency that need to be addressed.
        According to <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-how-the-us-and-the-world-are-regulating-bitcoin-and-cryptocurrency-2017-12-18">marketwatch.com</a> the concerns of law regulators are with money laundering, terrorist financing, tax evasion and fraud. Currently cryptocurrency is treated as a securities and it is regulated by the securities law framework based on the Securities act of 1933. However, on Decemeber 20, 2018 a new bill was introduced. It was the Token Taxonomy Act and according to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cryptocurrency-exemption-securities-law/">bitcoinist.com</a> "if passed, US securities law will no longer apply to virtual currency tokens once their projects become fully functioning networks."
